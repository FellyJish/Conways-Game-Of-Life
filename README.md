# Conways-Game-Of-LIfe

A C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life using the SFML graphics library.

Conway's Game of Life is probably the most popular cellular automaton. It consists of a two-dimensional ortogonal grid of cells which are either alive or dead.

Every update, each cell checks how many of its eight neighbours are alive.

Depending on how many neighbours are alive, the following happens:  
A **living** cell with fewer than two, or more than three living neighbours dies.  
A **dead** cell with three living neighbours comes to life.

Enjoy!
